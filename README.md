## Large language model vs humans: alternate uses test

The alternate uses test (AUT) is an experiment which gives a participant an everyday object, such as a brick or a paperclip, and asks them to generate 
as many alternative uses as they can. The test is considered by cognitive psychologists to be associated with divergent thinking and creativity. A 
number of recently-released large language models are given the alternate uses test, and their performance measured against human performance.
